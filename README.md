# CloLex: Exploring Closed Lexicals for LegalTech

The repository contains the full codebase of experiments and results of the paper "CloLex: Exploring Closed Lexicals for LegalTech".

## Overview
This project focuses on leveraging Artificial Intelligence to enhance the efficiency of the judicial system, particularly in predicting legal judgments. As of 2022, the Supreme Court of India faces a backlog of over 70,000 cases, highlighting the need for innovative solutions to expedite the legal process.

Our contributions can be summarized as below:
* The repository includes a substantial dataset comprising 54,000 Indian Supreme Court cases. This diverse collection serves as the foundation for developing and evaluating models for automated legal judgment prediction.
* The project involves a meticulous comparison of various baseline models, employing globally accepted binary case categories, specifically civil and criminal. The aim is to establish a robust framework for automated legal judgment prediction, enhancing the efficiency of the judicial system.
* An important insight from the project is the significance of processing legal documents separately based on the specific legal domain (civil or criminal). The results demonstrate improved prediction scores for both civil and criminal cases when documents are segregated according to their legal domain, as opposed to mixed law documents.
